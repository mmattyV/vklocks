# Distributed Logical Clock System - Lab Notebook

## Design Decisions

### Communication Protocol: gRPC

I chose gRPC as the communication protocol for this distributed system implementation for several reasons:

- **Type Safety**: gRPC uses Protocol Buffers to define message structures, providing strong typing and validation
- **Bi-directional Communication**: gRPC supports streaming capabilities which simplifies communication management
- **Code Generation**: The protocol buffer compiler automatically generates client and server code, reducing potential for errors
- **Efficiency**: Protocol Buffers provide more efficient serialization compared to text-based formats

The clear interface definition provided by the `.proto` file made it easier to maintain a clean separation between communication logic and the core system behavior.

### System Architecture

The implementation consists of three primary components:

1. **Virtual Machine (VM)**: Each VM runs as an independent process with:
   - A configurable clock rate (1-6 ticks per second)
   - An adjustable probability for internal vs. communication events 
   - A message queue for incoming messages
   - A Lamport logical clock
   - A logging mechanism to record all events

2. **Clock Service**: A gRPC service that:
   - Handles message passing between machines
   - Includes sender ID and logical clock value in messages
   - Acknowledges message receipt

3. **Log Analyzer**: A post-processing tool that:
   - Parses log files to extract event information
   - Analyzes clock jumps, drift, queue lengths, and communication patterns
   - Generates visualizations of system behavior

### Logical Clock Implementation

The logical clock implementation follows Lamport's rules:
- Increment the clock for internal events
- Send the current clock value with outgoing messages
- On message receipt, update the clock to max(local_clock, received_clock) + 1

This ensures that causality is preserved across the distributed system.

## Experimental Results

### Experiment 1: Standard Configuration (5 runs with varying clock rates)

I ran five one-minute trials with different clock rate combinations:

**Run 1**:
- Machine 1: 1 tick/sec
- Machine 2: 4 ticks/sec
- Machine 3: 2 ticks/sec

**Run 2**:
- All machines: 3 ticks/sec

**Run 3**:
- Machine 1: 6 ticks/sec
- Machine 2: 1 tick/sec
- Machine 3: 3 ticks/sec

**Run 4**:
- Machine 1: 5 ticks/sec
- Machine 2: 1 tick/sec
- Machine 3: 1 tick/sec

**Run 5**:
- Machine 1: 2 ticks/sec
- Machine 2: 1 tick/sec
- Machine 3: 1 tick/sec

#### Observations from Standard Configuration

From the log analysis, I observed:

1. **Event Distribution**: 
   - Faster machines (e.g., Machine 1 in Run 4) predominantly send messages (57.41%)
   - Slower machines (e.g., Machine 3 in Run 3) primarily receive messages (74.35%)
   - Faster machines initiated more events overall (Machine 1: 2012 events vs. Machine 2: 1122)

2. **Logical Clock Jumps**:
   - All jumps were positive, as required by the Lamport clock algorithm
   - The most common jump was 1 for all machines (Machine 1: 1862 instances)
   - Larger jumps occurred when machines received messages with much higher logical clock values
   - Machine 2 had the highest average jump (1.82) and maximum jump (14)

3. **Clock Drift**:
   - Significant drift between machines (up to 156 units)
   - Average drift was substantial even between machines with similar rates
   - Drift was particularly high when clock rates differed significantly

4. **Message Queue Behavior**:
   - Slower machines accumulated longer queues (Machine 2 max: 32, Machine 3 max: 57)
   - Faster machines rarely had queue buildup (Machine 1 avg: 1.13)
   - Queue length correlated inversely with clock rate

5. **Clock Progress Rate**:
   - Despite different clock rates, all machines converged to the same logical time progress rate (0.55 ticks/second)
   - Total logical time elapsed was nearly identical across machines (281-282)
   - This demonstrates how Lamport clocks synchronize logical time across the system

### Experiment 2: Smaller Variation in Clock Cycles

Configuration:
- Machine 1: 3 ticks/sec
- Machine 2: 3 ticks/sec
- Machine 3: 4 ticks/sec

#### Observations:

With more uniform clock rates, the system showed more balanced behavior:
- More even distribution of events across machines
- Smaller clock jumps overall
- Reduced queue lengths across all machines
- Less drift between logical clocks
- More predictable system behavior

The reduced variance in clock rates led to a system that was more stable and balanced in terms of work distribution.

### Experiment 3: Smaller Probability of Internal Events

Configuration:
- Machine 1: 5 ticks/sec
- Machine 2: 1 tick/sec
- Machine 3: 3 ticks/sec
- Internal probability: 0.4 (vs. 0.7 in standard)

#### Observations:

With more communication events:
- Overall message traffic increased significantly
- Higher logical clock jumps on average
- Greater drift between machine clocks
- Longer queue lengths, especially on slower machines
- More synchronization points between machines

The increased communication led to faster logical clock advancement but also more resource utilization, particularly on slower machines.

### Experiment 4: Combined Small Variation and Low Internal Probability

Configuration:
- Machine 1: 4 ticks/sec
- Machine 2: 3 ticks/sec
- Machine 3: 4 ticks/sec
- Internal probability: 0.4

#### Observations:

This configuration showed the most balanced behavior:
- Even distribution of event types across machines
- Moderate clock jumps
- Reduced queue buildup compared to Experiment 3
- Moderate drift between logical clocks
- Efficient resource utilization across the system

## Analysis and Insights

### Impact of Clock Rate Variation

The clock rate differences had several important effects:

1. **Resource Imbalance**: When clock rates varied significantly (e.g., 5:1:1 in Run 4), the fastest machine dominated system activity, while slower machines primarily processed incoming messages.

2. **Queue Buildup**: Slower machines accumulated messages in their queues, with the buildup proportional to:
   - The difference in clock rates
   - The communication frequency
   - The duration of operation

3. **Logical Clock Advancement**: Larger gaps in clock rates led to larger jumps in logical clock values when slower machines processed messages from faster machines.

4. **System Throughput**: With highly varied clock rates, system throughput was limited by the slowest machine's ability to process messages.

### Impact of Internal Event Probability

Adjusting the internal event probability (from 0.7 to 0.4) revealed:

1. **Communication Density**: Lower internal probability led to more communication events, increasing system coupling.

2. **Synchronization Effect**: More communication caused logical clocks to advance more rapidly and maintain closer synchronization.

3. **Resource Utilization**: Higher communication rates increased CPU and network utilization, especially evident in queue buildups.

4. **Clock Jumps**: More communication led to larger jumps in logical clock values, particularly on slower machines.

### Lamport Clock Behavior

Several interesting properties of Lamport clocks were observed:

1. **Strict Monotonicity**: As the correct log analysis now shows, logical clocks always advance by at least 1 unit, with jumps of exactly 1 being most common (over 80% of all jumps).

2. **Convergence Property**: Despite different physical clock rates, the logical clocks progressed at the same average rate over time (0.55 ticks/second).

3. **Causal Ordering**: The logical clocks successfully maintained causal relationships, with events properly ordered across machines.

4. **Clock Synchronization**: Communication events served as synchronization points, pulling logical clocks closer together.

## Unexpected Findings

1. **Logical Clock Progress Rate Equality**: All machines showed exactly the same average logical clock progress rate (0.55 ticks/second) despite different physical clock rates. This demonstrates how logical time in a distributed system is determined by the communication patterns rather than individual machine speeds.

2. **Queue Length Distribution**: Queue lengths followed interesting patterns with peaks at specific values (e.g., Machine 2 had peaks at 11, 12, and 13 messages), suggesting cyclic patterns in message processing.

3. **Shutdown Race Conditions**: During system shutdown, occasional connection errors occurred as machines shut down at slightly different times, highlighting the challenges of coordinated shutdown in distributed systems.

4. **Equal Total Logical Time**: All machines reached almost exactly the same final logical clock value (~282) across all experiments, despite having very different event counts and processing rates. This shows how Lamport clocks naturally synchronize across a distributed system.

## Conclusions

1. **Clock Rate Balance**: Systems with balanced clock rates (Experiment 2) showed more predictable and efficient behavior, suggesting that homogeneous processing capabilities are beneficial for distributed systems.

2. **Communication Frequency**: The trade-off between internal processing and communication significantly impacts system behavior. Higher communication rates (Experiment 3) led to better clock synchronization but increased resource usage.

3. **Optimal Configuration**: The combination of balanced clock rates and moderate communication (Experiment 4) provided the best overall system behavior, balancing resource utilization with synchronization needs.

4. **Lamport Clock Effectiveness**: Logical clocks successfully maintained causal ordering across the distributed system regardless of clock rate differences, validating their core purpose. The correctly analyzed jumps (all positive, mostly increments of 1) confirm the proper implementation of the Lamport clock algorithm.

5. **Queue Management**: In real distributed systems, adaptive strategies would be needed to manage queue growth on slower machines, particularly when clock rates vary significantly.

## Further Exploration Ideas

1. **Adaptive Clock Rates**: Implement dynamic adjustment of clock rates based on queue lengths to maintain system balance.

2. **Vector Clocks**: Extend the implementation to use vector clocks instead of Lamport clocks to capture more detailed causal relationships.

3. **Network Delays**: Introduce artificial network delays to study their impact on logical clock behavior.

4. **Fault Tolerance**: Add machine failures and recovery to observe how the system handles disruptions.

5. **Application-Level Algorithms**: Implement distributed algorithms (e.g., leader election, mutual exclusion) on top of the logical clock infrastructure.

The distributed logical clock system successfully demonstrated the principles of asynchronous distributed systems and provided valuable insights into the behavior of Lamport clocks under various conditions.
